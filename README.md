# Go Travel

## About The Project
Go Travel is a mobile application built with React Native for travelers who want to explore different destinations and get information about them.

It provides comprehensive guidance to travelers, offering a detailed and complete list of information, such as the best hangout spots and top-rated restaurants in the city. The app aims to solve common problems encountered by travelers, including selecting the right destination and finding suitable options based on specific keywords.

Go Travel utilizes real-time information to keep users up-to-date on monuments, restaurants, hotels, and places of interest in unfamiliar cities. The app's user-friendly interface makes it easy for users to navigate and find necessary information for trip planning.
